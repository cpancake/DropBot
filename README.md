# DropBot

DropBot is a Runescape bot / automation for dropping all items of a single type from your player's inventory. It's pretty buggy, and has some hardcoded assumptions that probably won't work out for you, but since I don't play Runescape anymore I can't really justify working on this any further.

You can find more details about this bot [here](https://cpancake.me/open-source-dropbot.html).
